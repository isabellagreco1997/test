    </p>
    <p>This manual covers both the platform as well as the CrochetPARADE
        grammar. NOTE: This manual is work in progress. Last updated: Aug 14, 2024.</p>
    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>CrochetPARADE (Crochet PAttern Renderer, Analyzer, and DEbugger) is a
        platform that allows users to create, visualize, and analyze both 2D and
        3D crochet patterns.</p>
    <h3 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p>CrochetPARADE uses a custom language grammar that allows users to
        define stitches and stitch patterns. The CrochetPARADE grammar aims to
        ensure accuracy and precision in the crochet pattern instructions,
        avoiding the ambiguities encountered with instructions in plain English.
        The code parses and checks any user provided pattern for correctness and
        then creates a virtual model of the project, which is then rendered in
        3D.</p>
    <p>After rendering a pattern, users can review (‘debug’) the final
        project’s shape and make adjustments. The platform identifies overly
        loose or tight stitches, enabling users to replace them with more
        suitable ones before crocheting, thus reducing the need for
        blocking.</p>
    <p>CrochetPARADE’s export feature allows users to generate an SVG image
        that shows stitch connections and identifies stitches by their type, row
        number, and position within a row. The SVG pattern shows the same
        information as standard crochet diagrams and can be used as a guide when
        crocheting. Users can also export projects to 3D files that can be
        imported in <a href="https://www.blender.org">Blender</a> for further
        manipulation and visualization.</p>
    <p>CrochetPARADE includes interactive features such as the ability to
        rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D view, as well as animating the pattern
        creation process, which can help in visualizing how stitches attach to
        each other. Additional features include highlighting and hiding selected
        stitches, and changing yarn thickness and color. Users can access stitch
        information by hovering over stitches in the 3D view.</p>
    <p>CrochetPARADE performs all calculations locally on your device,
        ensuring that no data is collected to a central server or transmitted
        over the internet. As a side effect, the platform can be sluggish on old
        hardware. Models of patterns involving (tens of) thousands of stitches
        can take minutes or more to calculate.</p>
    <h3 id="goals-and-possible-applications">GOALS AND POSSIBLE
        APPLICATIONS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The main goal of CrochetPARADE is to facilitate crochet project
                design and execution.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Patterns created with CrochetPARADE can be easily shared,
                ensuring they are free from ambiguities or typographic mistakes.
                Creators can simply copy and paste the pattern text to share it, and
                others can use the CrochetPARADE platform to render the shared text into
                a model of the pattern exactly as intended by the pattern
                author.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>CrochetPARADE can be used in education to teach crocheting but
                also programming skills, since the CrochetPARADE grammar follows rules
                similar to those of real programming languages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The virtual models created by CrochetPARADE can be imported in 3D
                modelling and CGI software. Picture an animated movie where characters
                wear crochet hats and sweaters that match real-world crochet
                projects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It is probably inevitable that the grammar along with the
                renderer can allow AI to learn how to write correct crochet instructions
                of complicated patterns (beyond simple amigurumi) based on general
                project descriptions.</p>

        <li>ctrl+r (experimental!): Same as the previous one, but recalculates

    <h1 id="the-3d-visualization-canvas">The 3D visualization canvas</h1>
    <p>The 3D view shows how stitches are connected between each other. Each
        sphere represents the top “V” of a crochet stitch. Stitches in
        crocheting are worked sequentially often forming rows or rounds (or can
        be forming more general patterns). In the default view, the overall
        direction of working the stitches is illustrated by the blue connections
        between stitches (with arrowheads showing the direction). Red
        connections show the rest of the connections between the stitches. The
        arrowheads of those connections show which stitch they are associated
        with. So for example in <code>dc,sc,dc</code>, the single crochet stitch
        will connect with a blue connections to the <code>dc</code> stitches,
        and with a red connection to the stitch in which it is worked.</p>
    <p>Information about stitches is shown when hovering over a stitch. It
        shows stitch row and number with row followed by <code>|</code> and the
        stitch number in the whole project in parenthesis, for example
        <code>(4,23|410)</code>. <strong>Note that counting of rows and stitch
            numbers starts from 0!</strong> So in this example, this is the 24-th
        stitch in the 5-th row. Note that the overall stitch counter (in this
        case <code>410</code>) counts non-stitches as well, such as
        <code>sk</code>, and does not count internal stitches such as stitches
        in bobbles or popcorns. Then, in square brackets, the information box shows the type of the stitch that is highlighted (sc for single crochet, ch for chain, etc.).
        The next line starts with
        <strong><code>C1:</code></strong> and shows “first level of context”,
        meaning where the stitch is relative to the rest of the stitches in the
        input instructions. <strong><code>C2:</code></strong> shows the “second
        level of context” which shows the context of the stitch within the
        instructions after evaluation of any variables (see below).</p>
    <p>See the keyboard shortcuts for further information.</p>
    <h1 id="saveexport-options">Save/Export options</h1>
    <p>The project can be exported in different formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Plain text, which is suitable for sharing. Note that every line
                (indicating a new row/round) will be preceded by <code>¶</code> in order
                to ensure that spurious new lines introduced by sharing the instructions
                over text-platforms will not count. If such a text is pasted back into
                the platform, those extra <code>¶</code> symbols will automatically be
                deleted. The plain text also carries version information on top, which
                would ensure backward compatibility if the language evolves.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Print highlighted instructions in the way one sees them in the
                input field. Intended new lines are preceded by <code>¶</code> similar
                to above. Unintended new lines created by line-wrapping are
                not.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Save the project's nodes and edges to a DOT-like file. Node coordinates (if precalculated) are included
                as a tuple after the node name. Edge lengths are included as a float after each edge.
                Note that positions of stitches will be included if the model was calculated already.
                Also, note that the file is not fully
                compatible with Graphviz.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Export 3D GLTF model. The model that is exported can be previewed

    <h1 id="the-crochetparade-language">The CrochetPARADE language</h1>
    <p>Below is the description of the CrochetPARADE language used to enter
        crochet patterns on the platform.</p>
    <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
    <p>Stitches are defined using common names <code>ch</code> for a chain,
        <code>sc</code> for single crochet,
        <code>ss</code> for slip-stitch, <code>dc</code> for double crochet,
        etc. CrochetPARADE comes with built in set of some common stitches.
        Stitches can also be defined using methods described further below in
        this chapter.</p>
    <p>Two special "stitches" are: <code>sk</code> for skip a stitch, and <code>turn</code> for turning the work. (See
        "Direction of sequential stitch attachment." for more details.) Note that, <code>turn</code> can only
        appear as a last "stitch" in a row, and should be followed by a new line:
        <pre><code>10ch,turn
sk,ch,9sc,turn
sk,ch,9sc
</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>CrochetPARADE can handle automatically stitch increases and decreases with
        <code>stitch_nameNinc</code> and <code>stitch_nameNtog</code>, respectively. Here <code>N</code>
        is an integer denoting the number of stitches of the increase or decrease. For example: <code>sc2inc</code>
        corresponds to two single-crochet stitches worked into the same stitch; and <code>sc2tog</code> implies
        that one is doing a decrease by combining two single-crochet stitches.
    </p>
    <p>Stitching in the front and back loops is done by adding 'fl' or 'bl' at the end of a stitch name, such as
        <code>scbl</code> (single crochet in the back loop), <code>dcfl</code> (double crochet in the front loop), etc. By default,
        only the basic stitches (ss, sc, hdc, dc, tr, dtr,trtr) are supported with the 'bl' and 'fl' options.
        Also, one cannot combine 'fl/bl' with 'Ninc/Ntog'.
        If you want to add the 'fl/bl' option to other stitches, then
        one should use a raw stitch definition (see "Raw stitch definitions and grammar").
    </p>
    <p>Stitches can be repeated by multiplying them with an integer, say
        <code>10*sc</code> or <code>10 sc</code> or <code>10sc</code> would
        imply 10 single crochet stitches.</p>
    <p>Each new line is a new row/round. Rows with stitches are enumerated
        in the editor. The enumeration will be inaccurate if you are repeating
        rows by multiplying whole rows with an integer. One can repeat rows by
        adding an extra new line in the end, encompassing the whole expression
        in parenthesis or brackets, and then multiplying by a number. For
        example</p>
    <pre><code>[10sc,turn
]*3</code></pre>
    <p>is parsed to:</p>
    <pre><code>10sc,turn
10sc,turn
10sc,turn</code></pre>
    <p>The last iteration can be ended prematurely by adding a
        <code>&gt;</code> as in: <code>[2sc,&gt;,dc]*3</code> is parsed to
        <code>2sc,dc,2sc,dc,2sc</code>. Similarly, the first iteration can start
        at a location marked with <code>&lt;</code>. Thus,
        <code>[2sc,&lt;,dc]*3</code> will be parsed to
        <code>dc,2sc,dc,2sc,dc</code>. Note that <code>&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;</code> should be at the top level (meaning not nested within
        other parenthesis) of the iterated expression.</p>
    <p>Rows/rounds that are too long can be wrapped by starting a new line
        with <code>...</code>. So:</p>
    <pre><code>3dc
... sc,turn</code></pre>
    <p>will be evaluated to <code>3dc,sc,turn</code> as part of the same
        row/round.</p>
    <p>Comments can be entered after <code>#</code> and end at a new line.
        Multiline (and single-word/single-line) comments can be entered between
        two back slashes <code>\</code> . See the examples below.</p>
    <p>One can change the color of the “yarn” by using
        <code>COLOR: color of stitches to follow</code>. For more information,
        see the dedicated chapter on color. The background color can be changed
        by setting <code>BACKGROUND: color of background</code>, appearing alone on a new line.</p>
    <pre><code>COLOR: rgb(126,8,80)
DOT: any extra arguments to the physics engine

BACKGROUND: white</code></pre>
    <h3 id="color">Color</h3>
    <p>Setting the yarn or background color is done by writing:</p>
    <pre><code>COLOR: color_name or hex color or rgb(r,g,b)</code></pre>
    <pre><code>BACKGROUND: color_name or hex color or rgb(r,g,b)</code></pre>
    <p>The supported colors are any of the ones listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names#Color_name_chart">here</a>.
        Hexadecimal color code is also supported. For more information, see the
        <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Color">three.js
            documentation</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="dot-command">DOT command</h3>
    <p>One can add additional commands to the dot file by
        adding those after a <code>DOT:</code> at the beginning of the line:</p>
    <pre><code>    # a (hidden) node:
    DOT: &quot;3,27B&quot;
    # creating a new connection outside of a stitch of length 9.0:
    DOT: &quot;1,54&quot; -- &quot;1,44&quot; 9.0
    # iterations (default: 500) until the code terminates the computation
    DOT: iterations=1000
    # seed for the random number generator:
    DOT: start=10
    # Factor by which to separate disjoint crochet pieces (default: 1.5)
    DOT: separate=0.8
    #The inflate keyword sets how much to "inflate" the project. 
    #It controls how much distant stitches (which are not 
    #directly connected) push off of each other. Setting this
    #parameter slows down the code by a factor of two or so.
    #The default value for inflate is infinity. Reasonable values 
    #to try are 0.5-3.0.
    DOT: inflate=2.0
    #The learning rate controls the rate at which the code converges. 
    #Setting it too high (above 0.15 or so) can cause failure to 
    #converge. Default: 0.1
    DOT: learning_rate=0.02</code></pre>
    <h2 id="specifying-attachment-points">Specifying attachment points</h2>
    <p>Stitches on a given row/round are automatically attached one-by-one
        to consecutive stitches in the previous row/round. If the work is turned
        at the end of a row, then that is taken into account automatically.</p>
    <p>However, in crocheting often one needs to attach (“work”) new
        stitches to non-consecutive previous stitches. To allow that, the code
        allows specifying attachment points after the <code>@</code> symbol,
        following a stitch in a pattern, e.g. <code>3sc,dc@[-1,3],dc</code>,
        which specifies that the attachment point of the dc stitch should be
        moved to the 4 stitch (stitch and row counting start from zero) of the
        previous row/round (specified with a negative index: <code>-1</code>).
        The next <code>dc</code> is worked in the stitch after that.</p>
    <p>There are different ways of specifying stitch attachment points:</p>
    <h3 id="direct-attachment-210">Direct Attachment: @[2,10]</h3>
    <p>Direct attachment to a particular stitch coordinate specified as a
        pair of integers, e.g. <code>@[2,10]</code>. The first integer specifies
        the row/round number. The second integer specifies the stitch in that
        row. Counting of stitches/rows/rounds starts from 0, so in the example
        above, the attachment is at the 11-th stitch of the 3-rd row.</p>
    <p>Negatives numbers imply counting from the end, starting with
        <code>-1</code> meaning the last stitch/row/round; <code>-2</code> the
        last but one stitch/row/round, etc. Counting of rows/rounds starts at
        the beginning of the project. Counting of stitches starts at the first
        stitch of the row as written down in the instructions, disregarding any <code>turn</code> directives. The current
        stitch row and stitch position can be specified using the <code>%</code>
        symbol, so <code>@[%,%-3]</code> implies the current row, three stitches
        back before the currently worked stitch.</p>
    <h3 id="attachment-with-stitch-type-counting-sc-13">Attachment with
        stitch type counting @[sc:-1,3]</h3>
    <p>Attachments with a stitch type before a colon specify that the
        counting of stitches in a row is over stitches of that type. For
        example, <code>@[sc:-1,3]</code> specifies that the current stitch is
        worked in the 4th single crochet (sc) stitch of the previous row, as
        opposed to the 4th stitch in general. The direction of counting is <b>not</b> necessarily in the direction
        in which the stitches were written (compare with above), but in the crocheting direction.
        See the section "Direction of sequential stitch attachment".</p>
    <h3 id="attachment-with-relative-position-1">Attachment with Relative
        Position: @[@+1]</h3>
    <p>The <strong>last</strong> attachment point is stored in the
        <code>@</code> symbol, which can be referenced in an attachment point.
        So, for example <code>dc,dc@[@]</code> implies that the second
        <code>dc</code> stitch should be worked in the same stitch as the
        previous <code>dc</code> stitch.</p>
    <p>One can go up and down the row by adding integers to <code>@</code>.
        So, <code>@[@+2]</code> means attach two stitches after the
        <strong>last</strong> attachment point. The direction is in the
        direction in which we are working (see the section "Direction of sequential stitch attachment")
        , so turns are taken into account.</p>
    <p>One can also combine relative position identifier with a stitch type
        identifier. For instance, <code>@[sc:@+1]</code> means attach to the
        next <code>sc</code> stitch after the last attachment point. Note that
        <code>@[sc:@]</code> and <code>@[sc:@+1]</code> imply the same
        attachment point (the next <code>sc</code>) if the last attachment was
        <strong>not</strong> at a <code>sc</code> stitch. If it were at a
        <code>sc</code> stitch, then <code>@[sc:@]</code> refers to attaching to
        that same stitch, whereas <code>@[sc:@+1]</code> implies attaching to
        the next <code>sc</code> in the row.</p>
    <h3 id="attachment-to-a-label">Attachment to a label</h3>
    <h4 id="simple-labels">Simple labels</h4>
    <p>In crocheting, one often uses stitch markers to keep track of
        particular stitch positions. Similarly, any stitch here can be labeled
        with a label following a <code>.</code>. For example, in
        <code>sc,sc.A,2ch</code> the second <code>sc</code> is labeled with a
        label <code>A</code>. A stitch can have multiple labels that have the
        distributive property. So, <code>(3ch.A,sc).B</code> implies that all
        chains have both labels <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, whereas the
        <code>sc</code> stitch carries label <code>B</code> only.</p>
    <p>One can then work a stitch in that label by attaching to
        <code>A</code> by writing <code>sc,sc.A,2ch,ss@A</code>. When multiple
        similar labels need to be used, one can use labels that differ by
        internal labels that are integers, such as
        <code>sc,sc.A[0],sc,sc,sc.A[1]</code>. Here <code>A[0]</code> and
        <code>A[1]</code> are treated as different labels.</p>
    <h4 id="labeled-groups-of-stitches">Labeled groups of stitches</h4>
    <h5 id="basics-1">Basics</h5>
    <p>When multiple stitches carry the same label, we will call that a
        labeled group. One can attach to the whole group, or particular stitches
        in the group. For example <code>5ch.A</code>, the label <code>A</code>
        refers to the whole 5 chain group. One can envision attaching to the
        chain space of that group by doing: <code>5ch.A,dc,2ch,2sc@A</code>. In
        this case, both <code>sc</code> stitches will attach to the chain-5
        space and will be distributed uniformly over that space. If the
        uniformly distributed positions do not match preexisting nodes of
        stitches in the labeled group, then hidden nodes will be created in
        between and the stitches will attach to those. That assumes all stitches
        in a labeled group have the same width (stitch height can vary).</p>
    <h5 id="attaching-to-the-the-post-of-a-stitch-.a-.a1">Attaching to the
        the post of a stitch: .A^ .A^1</h5>
    <p>To attach to the post of a stitch, follow the definition of the label
        with <code>^</code>. An integer can follow <code>^</code> specifying
        which post of the stitch to attach to if more than one. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>8*ch,turn
7*sc,dc.B^,turn
5ch,4*sc@B</code></pre>
    <p>Here is two example with two different posts as attachment
        points:</p>
    <pre><code>8ch,turn
6sc,dc2tog.B^0,turn
5ch,4*sc@B</code></pre>
    <p>which can be compared with:</p>
    <pre><code>8ch,turn
6sc,dc2tog.B^1,turn
5ch,4*sc@B</code></pre>
    <h5 id="skipping-border-stitches-of-a-group-.a-.a0-.a1">Skipping border
        stitches of a group: .A! .A!0 .A!1</h5>
    <p>If one wants to attach a set of stitches to a stitch group, then the
        default is that the two border stitches (first and last) of the group
        are valid attachment points of the set. One may however, want to skip
        those, and instead attach in the spaces and stitches in between those
        border stitches. Then adding defining a label, one can add
        <code>!</code> if one wants to skip both bordering stitches,
        <code>!0</code> if one wants to skip the beginning stitch, and
        <code>!1</code> if one wants to skip the last stitch.</p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <pre><code>10ch,turn
sk,9sc,turn
ch,2sc,4ch.A!,4sk,3sc,turn
4ch,5sc@A,4ch,sc</code></pre>
    <p>The 5 <code>sc</code> stitches will attach in the 4-chain space
        labeled with <code>A</code>, avoiding the first and last
        <code>ch</code>. Render the same instruction set with
        <code>4ch.A</code>, <code>4ch.A!0</code>, <code>4ch.A!1</code> to see
        the difference. Note that the reference <code>@A</code> should not
        contain the <code>!</code> instruction.</p>
    <p>One can combine the <code>!</code> modifier with the <code>^</code>
        modifier:</p>
    <pre><code>8*ch,turn
7*sc,dc.B^!,turn
5ch,4*sc@B</code></pre>
    <p>Here is a topology that is a bit more involved:</p>
    <pre><code>9ch,turn
8sc,dc.A^,turn
4ch,[sc,sc.B^!,sc]@A
4ch,3sc@B</code></pre>
    <h5 id="adding-edge-stitches-to-a-group-.a-.a0-.a1-.a-.a0">Adding edge
        stitches to a group: .A+ .A+0 .A+1 .A+! .A+!0</h5>
    <p>Let’s say, you’d like to attach stitches in a chain space. If you
        want the stitches to fill in the space evenly up to the stitches
        bordering the chain space, you would have to add the stitches before
        and/or after the chain space to the labeled chain-space group. That can
        be cumbersome. So, to do that automatically add a <code>+</code> after
        the chain-space label definition to add both bordering stitches, or
        <code>+0</code>/<code>+1</code> to add the previous/next
        borderingstitch.</p>
    <p>Compare the following:</p>
    <pre><code>8ch,turn
2sc,3ch.C+,2sc,turn
3ch,5sc@C,sc@[-1,0]</code></pre>
    <p>with</p>
    <pre><code>8ch,turn
2sc,3ch.C+!,2sc,turn

    <h5 id="reversing-the-order-of-attaching-a-set-of-stitches-to-a-group-of-stitches-a">Reversing
        the order of attaching a set of stitches to a group of stitches: <span class="citation" data-cites="A">@A</span>~</h5>
    <p>When attaching a set of stitches to a group of stitches, the code is
        trying to do its best, to order the attachments in a way that is least
        disruptive (i.e. twisting) to the project, but sometimes it fails. For
        example, render the following:</p>
    <pre><code>10ch,turn
sk,8sc,sc.A!,turn
4ch.A!,sk,9tr,turn
1ch,sk,8sc,7sc@A</code></pre>
    <p>If you want the 7 <code>sc</code> stitches attaching to the 4-chain
        group be attached in reverse order, then append a <code>~</code> to the
        end of the attachment label, as in:</p>
    <pre><code>10ch,turn
sk,8sc,sc.A!,turn
4ch.A!,sk,9tr,turn
1ch,sk,8sc,7sc@A~</code></pre>
    <p>Compare with the result from running the previous set of
        instructions.</p>
    <p>See the section "Direction of sequential stitch attachment" for the way the code chooses the default direction of attaching stitches.</p>
    <h5 id="multiple-stitch-sets-attaching-to-a-labeled-group-a21">Multiple
        stitch sets attaching to a labeled group: <span class="citation" data-cites="A">@A</span>[2;1]</h5>
    <p>If one needs to attach multiple sets of stitches into a labeled
        stitch group, then the order in which those sets are attached can be
        specified with a semi-colon as follows:
        <code>6dc.A[12],5ch,3sc@A[12;1],3sc@A[12;0]</code>. In this example, the
        <strong>second</strong> set of 3 sc stitches will be attached to the
        <strong>first</strong> 3 dc stitches, and the first 3 sc’s will attach
        to the second 3 sc’s. Note that to use this functionality, one needs to
        have a label with square brackets, such as <code>A[12]</code>. If no
        order is specified, then the stitch sets are attached in the same order
        as written, so in <code>6dc.A[12],5ch,3sc@A[12],3sc@A[12]</code>, the 6
        <code>sc</code> stitches attach consecutively in the 6 <code>dc</code>
        stitches.</p>
    <p>Note that each set can be reversed if you append a <code>~</code> at
        the end of the attachment label. Compare:</p>
    <pre><code>10ch,turn
sk,8sc,sc.A[]!,turn
4ch.A[]!,sk,9tr,turn
1ch,sk,8sc,3sc@A[;1]~,4sc@A[;0]</code></pre>
    <p>with</p>
    <pre><code>10ch,turn
sk,8sc,sc.A[]!,turn

        a particular stitch in a labeled group: <span class="citation" data-cites="A">@A</span>[][2]</h5>
    <p>If one wants to attach to the <code>k</code>-th stitch carrying the
        same label, then same as above, one needs to have a label with square
        brackets, such as <code>A[0]</code> and the stitch position would follow
        in another set of square brackets: e.g. <code>@A[0][k]</code> attaches
        to the <code>k</code> stitch of the stitch group labeled
        <code>A[0]</code>. Counting is in the same direction as the default stitching direction (see "Direction of sequential stitch attachment" below).
    </p>
    <h4 id="labels-with-counters-a-k-and-.ak">Labels with counters: <span class="citation" data-cites="A">@A [++k]</span> and .A[++k]</h4>
    <p>Note that often, one needs to create multiple labels in an
        algorithmic fashion. One can then use a counter (a variable initialized
        to an integer and then possibly incremented). One initializes the
        counter by placing the intializing expression between two <code>$</code>
        signs, say <code>$k=0$</code> at the beginning of a line. Then one can
        increment that value by using the <code>++</code> or <code>--</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increment_and_decrement_operators">operators</a>
        , or writing <code>prev k</code> (same as <code>--k</code>) or
        <code>next k</code> (same as <code>++k</code>). For example,
        <code>$m=0$, sc.A[m],sc.A[m++],sc.A[m],sc.A[++m],sc.A[m],sc.A[prev m],sc.A[m]</code>
        is evaluated to
        <code>sc.A[0],sc.A[0],sc.A[1],sc.A[2],sc.A[2],sc.A[1],sc.A[1]</code>.</p>
    <p>Note that when distributing labels with counters, the counter is
        evaluated first before distribution when the stitches are enclosed in
        parentheses/brackets, or when an integer precedes a stitch without the
        <code>*</code> symbol. So, <code>$k=0$,2sc.A[k++],(dc,dc).A[k]</code>
        evaluates to <code>sc.A[0],sc.A[0],dc.A[1],dc.A[1]</code>. If a stitch
        is multiplied by an integer using the <code>*</code> operator, then the
        label is distributed before evaluating the counter. For example,
        <code>$k=1$, 3*dc.A[k++]</code> evaluates first to
        <code>$k=1$,dc.A[k++],dc.A[k++],dc.A[k++]</code> and then to
        <code>dc.A[1],dc.A[2],dc.A[3]</code>, whereas
        <code>$k=1$, 3dc.A[k++]</code> would evaluate the counter before
        distributing the label to give <code>dc.A[1],dc.A[1],dc.A[1]</code>.</p>
    <p>Note that counter algebra is permitted in the indexing. So, for
        example <code>$k=3$,sc@A[(k++)%5]*5</code> would use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo">mod operator</a>
        <code>%</code>, and would be parsed to
        <code>sc@A[3],sc@A[4],sc@A[0],sc@A[1],sc@A[2]</code>. This is especially
        useful when going in rounds, and the first label that you attach to is
        not of index <code>0</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="multiple-attachment-heads-0-1-2">Multiple attachment heads:
        <span class="citation" data-cites="0">@0</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="1">@1</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="2">@2</span></h3>
    <p>Note that in crocheting we may be going back and forth between
        crocheting in different rows, or more generally in different locations
        in a project. Then to keep track of where we are in those different
        attachment locations, we can use different “attachment heads”, each one
        labeled with an integer after the <code>@</code> symbol (the default
        <code>@</code> implies <code>@0</code>). The attachment head counters
        are independent. So, for example:
        <code>sc@[-1,2],dc@1[-2,3],sc@[@+2],dc@1[@1+2],tc</code> will attach the
        second <code>sc</code> at <code>[-1,4]</code>, and the second
        <code>dc</code> at <code>[-2,5]</code>; the <code>tc</code> will attach
        to the next stitch on the default head, so to <code>[-1,5]</code> (same
        as <code>tc@[@+1]</code>). We can use any of the labeling methods
        described above with any of the attachment heads.</p>
    <h3 id="attachment-of-an-empty-stitch">Attachment of an empty
        stitch</h3>
    <p>One can reset the attachment point anywhere in a row by using an
        empty stitch. For example, <code>sc,dc,@[@-1],tr</code> is equivalent to
        <code>sc,dc,tr@[@]</code>, both forcing the <code>tr</code> and
        <code>dc</code> stitches to attach to the same point. The logic is that
        the last attachment point after <code>dc</code>, is shifted back to the
        attachment of <code>sc</code> by the operator <code>@[@-1]</code>, so
        the next stitch <code>tr</code> attaches to the attachment point of
        <code>dc</code>.</p>


    <h2 id="defining-new-stitches.">Direction of sequential stitch attachment.</h2>

    <p>If no attachment point is specified, the code tries to infer the next attachment point of the next stitch you are working into your project.
        It does that by checking how many <code>turn</code> directives are at the end of the rows
        between the row (let's call it A for reference) of the attachment
        point of the previous stitch and the current row. If that number is even, then the next stitch would by default attach
        to the next stitch of A in the direction in which A was crocheted. If that number is odd, then
        the next stitch would attach to the previous stitch on A (as we are going in reverse order). This would match the natural
        direction in which one crochets when executing the actual project.
        <p> </p>
        If one is stitching in a labeled group of stitches by attaching to that label,
        then the default direction of crocheting is determined
        by the number of <code>turn</code> directives between the row of the <b>first</b> stitch of the labeled group
        and the row of that stitch of the set of stitches worked into that labeled group that comes first <b>after</b> the following
        is done: 1. If multiple sets of stitches attach to the same labeled group, sort them according to the order specified after <code>;</code>
        (as in stitches attached to <code>,A[0;0]</code> come before <code>A[0;1]</code>); and 2. Reverse the order of
        any set that has a modifier <code>~</code> after the attachment label (e.g. <code>@A~</code>).
        <p> </p>
        If working stitches in the post of a stitch, then then the default direction of crocheting is from the attachment point
        of the stitch to the top of the stitch, unless there is an odd number of <code>turn</code> directives between
        the row of the top
        of that stitch and the <b>first</b> stitch of the set of stitches that are
        worked into the post (after the same sorting has been done as in the previous paragraph).
    </p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> When attaching to stitches, the stitches that are enumerated correspond to all <b>top nodes</b> (see "raw stitch definitions" below)
        present in the stitches. That means that a stitch (say <code>sc2inc</code>, which is 2 sc in the same stitch)
        with two top nodes, will have each of those top nodes enumerated with sequential numbers in the row/round that is being worked. Stitches without top
        nodes (e.g. internally a skip, <code>sk</code>, is treated like a stitch without a top node) are not enumerated and therefore one cannot attach a stitch to them.
    </p>


    <h2 id="defining-new-stitches.">Defining new stitches.</h2>
    <p>New stitches are defined using <code>DEF: definition</code>, which should be placed alone on a new line.</p>
    <h3 id="creating-an-alias">Creating an alias</h3>
    <p>If you are using a sequence of stitches over and over again, you may
        want to create an alias for them. The syntax for that is:</p>
    <pre><code>DEF: new_stitch_sequence_alias=stitch1,stitch2,...
#Example:
DEF: p=3ch,ss@5[%,-4] 
# Used an arbitrary attachment head 5 (@5), different from the default.
# A similar stitch alias is used in the Flower example.</code></pre>
    <p>One can use an alias in a pattern in the same way one uses any
        stitch, with one notable exception: An alias will increase the stitch
        count in a row not by 1 but by however many stitches are in the
        sequence. The way an alias is handled is by a simple string
        substitution, so the calculated result will not reference the name of
        the alias in any way.</p>
    <p>The stitch alias <code>p</code> in the example above is a picot-3
        stitch: ch 3,then slip stitch into the stitch preceding the picot
        stitch.</p>
    <h3 id="copying-a-stitch-with-modifications.">Copying a stitch (with
        modifications).</h3>
    <p>Let us say a pattern requires you to use the reverse single crochet
        stitch (rsc). That stitch has roughly the same overall geometry (height
        and width) and topology (connectedness) as the single crochet stitch, so
        you can simply use the sc stitch. However, let us say you would like to
        use the name rsc in the pattern. Using <code>DEF: rsc=sc</code> is an
        option, but the name <code>rsc</code> will not appear in the rendered
        project. If you would like that name to show up in the rendered project
        as well, then you can <code>Copy()</code> the stitch:
        <code>DEF: new_stitch=Copy(old_stitch_name) # Example: DEF: scbl = Copy(sc) # This stitch is used in the Baby Bootie example.</code></p>
    <p>If you would like to adjust the height of the newly created or a
        pre-existing stitch, you could do:
        <code>DEF: new_stitch=Copy(old_stitch_name,new_height) # Example: DEF: dc=Copy(dc,3) # This stitch modification is used in the Blanket example.</code></p>
    <p>The example above overwrites the <code>dc</code> stitch with a new
        height of 3 units.</p>
    <p>You can also change the width of a stitch:
        <code>DEF: new_stitch=Copy(old_stitch_name, new_height, new_width) # Example: DEF: narrow_sc=Copy(sc,1,0.8) # Note: You have to specify the height if you are specifying # the width, as those are positional arguments.</code></p>
    <h3 id="raw-stitch-definitions-and-grammar.">Raw stitch definitions and
        grammar.</h3>
    <p>One can use “raw stitch” grammar to define new stitches in a concise
        manner. Internally, the code defines basic stitches using that shorthand
        notation. Stitches written that way are then translated to a JSON format
        internally. The grammar for defining a new stitch is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>DEF: new_stitch=&amp;comment^top_nodes:bottom_nodes~attachments:other_nodes:connections</code></pre>
    <p>The terms “top nodes” and “bottom nodes” here refer to specific parts
        of a crochet stitch. The top node corresponds to the top of a crochet
        stitch, often identified by the ‘V’ shape formed at the top of the
        stitch. This is where the hook is inserted when working a traditional
        crochet stitch. The bottom node, on the other hand, refers to the
        attachment points of the crochet stitches, which are the top nodes of
        other stitches previously made.</p>
    <p>Here is a breakdown of the different components of a new stitch
        defined this way:</p>
    <h4 id="comment">Comment</h4>
    <p>The comment field is optional and is defined at the beginning of the
        stitch definition, after the <code>&amp;</code> symbol and before the
        <code>^</code> symbol. They can be a brief description of the stitch,
        but are <strong>not</strong> used in the code. The comment cannot
        contain any of these characters: <code>^:~</code>. For example, in the
        stitch definition
        <code>&amp;a sc cluster of 3 stitches^A(sc):B~A-B:C;D;E;F;G;H:!-1-A;B-1/3-C;C-1/3-D;D-1/3-A;B-1/3-E;E-1/3-F;F-1/3-A;B-1/3-G;G-1/3-H;H-1/3-A</code>,
        the string <code>a sc cluster of 3 stitches</code> is a comment.</p>
    <h4 id="top-nodes">Top Nodes</h4>
    <p>Top nodes are defined after the <code>^</code> symbol and are
        separated by semicolons. Each top node must have a stitch type specified
        in parentheses after the stitch name. For example, in the stitch
        definition
        <code>&amp;sc2inc^A(sc);B(sc):C~::!-1-A;A-1-B;C-1-A;C-1-B</code>,
        <code>A(sc)</code> is a top node where <code>A</code> is the stitch name
        and <code>sc</code> is the stitch type. The order in which the top nodes
        are written specifies the order in which they are chained together.</p>
    <h4 id="bottom-nodes">Bottom Nodes</h4>
    <p>Bottom nodes are defined after the first <code>:</code> symbol and
        are separated by semicolons. Unlike top nodes, bottom nodes do not have
        stitch types specified in parentheses. Instead, they may have an
        optional number prefix that indicates the attachment depth. For example,
        in the stitch definition
        <code>&amp;funky^A(funky):B;2C;D~A-D::!-1-A;B-1-A;C-1-A;D-1-A</code>,
        <code>B</code> is a bottom node with an attachment depth of 1 (default
        when no number is specified), where <code>C</code> has an attachment
        depth of 2, meaning Stitch A attaches to the attachment point of
        <code>C</code>, and not to <code>C</code> directly.</p>
    <p>A bottom node followed by <code>[front]</code> or <code>[back]</code>
        specifies that the stitch is worked in the front/back loop. For example, the
        default definition of double crochet in the back loop is
        <code>&dcbl^A(dcbl):B[back]~A-B::!-1-A;B-2-A</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The order in which the bottom nodes are written specifies the
        attachment order of the current stitch to the top nodes of the previous
        stitches.</p>
    <h4 id="attachments">Attachments</h4>
    <p>Attachments are defined after the <code>~</code> symbol and are
        separated by semicolons. Each attachment is a pair of top and bottom
        node names separated by a <code>-</code>. The top node name must come
        first, followed by the bottom node name. For example, in the stitch
        definition <code>&amp;ss^A(ss):B~A-B::!-1-A;B-0.4-A</code>,
        <code>A-B</code> is an attachment indicating that top node
        <code>A</code> is attached to bottom node <code>B</code>. This is only
        used for finding the attachment point of a stitch, which has an
        attachment depth greater than 1.</p>
    <h4 id="other-nodes">Other Nodes</h4>
    <p>Other nodes are defined after the second <code>:</code> symbol and
        are separated by semicolons. Each other node must have a stitch type
        specified in parentheses after the stitch name. If no stitch type is
        specified, it defaults to <code>'hidden'</code>. For example, in the
        stitch definition
        <code>'&amp;a sc cluster of 3 stitches^A(sc):B~A-B:C;D;E;F;G;H:!-1-A;B-1/3-C;C-1/3-D;D-1/3-A;B-1/3-E;E-1/3-F;F-1/3-A;B-1/3-G;G-1/3-H;H-1/3-A'</code>,
        nodes <code>C</code> through <code>H</code> are all “other” nodes with
        type set to <code>hidden</code>.</p>
    <h4 id="connections">Connections</h4>
    <p>Connections are defined after the third <code>:</code> symbol and are
        separated by semicolons. Each connection is a pair of node names
        separated by a <code>-</code>, with a length value in between the
        hyphens. The first node (the tail of the connection) name must come
        first, followed by the length value, and then the second node (the head
        of the connection) name. For example, in the stitch definition
        <code>&amp;ss^A(ss):B~A-B::!-1-A;B-0.4-A</code>, <code>!-1-A</code> and
        <code>B-0.4-A</code> are connections indicating that node <code>!</code>
        is connected to node <code>A</code> with a length of <code>1</code>, and
        node <code>B</code> is connected to node <code>A</code> with a length of
        <code>0.4</code>. Note that node <code>!</code> represents the previous
        stitch, which the current stitch is connected to.</p>
    <p>Connections can be hidden, by preceding a connection with a
        <code>*</code>. For example, <code>*Z-3-F</code> is hidden, and is only
        rendered as thin gray threads.</p>
    <p>If one wants to add a top node that is disjoint from the previous top
        node, then one can use a length of <code>skip</code> for that
        connection. So, for example the internally defined “stitch”
        <code>start_anew</code> is defined as
        <code>&amp;start_anew^A(hidden):~::!-skip-A</code>. Thus, there is no
        connection between the next stitch and the previous stitch, similar to
        starting a new part of the project.</p>
    <h2 id="limitations-pitfalls-and-workarounds">Limitations, pitfalls and
        workarounds</h2>
    <h3 id="pitfalls">Pitfalls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Do not use variables with the same name as a stitch. (Would be
                nice to fix this.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Do not define stitches with the same name as variables. (Would be
                nice to fix this.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>An attachment point using @ as a coordinate, e.g. @[@+1], cannot work
                unless there was already at least one attached stitch on that row/round.
                That assigns the value of "@" to which we add the 1 in this example. This is by design. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When subscripting in labels using expressions, such as <span class="citation" data-cites="A">@A [N-(k)]</span>, put the parenthesis
                in, so that the js parser does not treat those as strings but
                as integers. (Would be nice to fix this.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The <code>turn</code> directive, should always be the last in a row/round/line of the code. No stitches can follow
                it, unless they are on a new line. (To do: An error should be generated if people do not follow this.)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Crocheting in the front and back loops is supported by adding 'bl' or 'fl' after standard crochet symbols such as 'scbl', 'dcbl', etc. or by
                using the raw stitch grammar as explained previously.
                However, the implementation is not perfect. Experiment with different starting seed values, e.g. <code>DOT: start=12 </code> if the stitches do not look quite right. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you want to attach stitches in the front/back post, the above
                also holds. Add a comment, and possibly shorten the stitch height,
                e.g. <code>dc_front_post=Copy(dc,1.5)</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In most experiments I have run, the computation engine converges to
                within 10% of the requested stitch lengths (even when it should get them
                exact) when using the default settings. So, take any variations of that magnitude as spurious. That is
                why only stitches over/under stretched by about 15% are shown when ‘s’
                is pressed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Any stitch information beyond stitch attachment (topology) and
                lengths should included as comments as it cannot be captured by the
                platform.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The computational engine is not yet aware when stitches cross. So for
                example, when creating a 3D project for a flower with picots in a loop
                in the center of the flower, the picots sometimes may be sticking in
                front or behind the petals. The only workaround for now is to try a
                different random seeds by setting <code>start</code> to some
                random integer. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>DOT: start=34254 </code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
